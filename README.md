The punnet square given above explains why we have 1/4 for the probability of having AaBb child when both parents are AaBb.

NOTE: 2**k comes from the assumption that two children are supposed to be born every generation for a couple, which makes 2 ** 1 in the first place, 2**2 in the second place and it goes on like that.
